Mobile footer button improvements:

- Footer buttons now full-width and properly centered (break out of container)
- Differentiated button styles: primary (blue filled) vs secondary (transparent with border)
- Removed duplicate download icon from buttons (FAB already has it)
- Added border to FAB to distinguish from footer buttons
- Rounded corners and proper spacing
